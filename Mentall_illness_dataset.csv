You are depressed: take vacation. You feel weird: admit it is physical (otherwise it is not serious) go and see a doctor (and if you are on sick leave too many days you will get fired). You don't feel good today: take a holiday but don't work from home. 

In startup there is what I call the tyranny of happiness: you have to look happy to be accepted and to be worked with. At some point playing a role can definitely make the mental health issue worse and it is also a threat to diversity :(

I don't like to call mental health issues an issue but actually when it comes to company field it too often becomes an issue and this is sad because working is sometimes better than medication. It is a vicious circle: people are scared of speaking about it so they don't inform their coworkers about what mental health is for real and so coworkers are so scared on a regular basis that the people with mental health ""issues"" keep it for themselves.

I had been struggling for 3 months prior to disclosure and was incredibly relieved when finally diagnosed. Growing up in a family open about mental health and also at the end of my rope, I immediately shared with management what was going on. I requested a temporary reduced workload so I could reduce anxiety. (At time I didn't know it was anxiety as took me a year to accept that the (to me) ""deserved"" stress was anxiety, caused by my core diagnosis.) When disclosing, I didn't deeply understand details of the state of my mental health; I simply knew I was so stressed out by having been unable to get myself to do work in three months that I couldn't juggle all that was currently on my plate.

It was at this point my direct manager and I began an almost daily struggle. After working on a single project and making progress (compared to 3 months before diagnosis when management didn't even know how bad I was doing), I requested increasing my workload. This was never granted; boss said I hadn't proved myself and implied I could not be trusted.

Two huge issues stick out to me from that experience:
1) Company assumes things would be better and back to 100% within months. They did not understand what one goes through when figuring out meds: things at times got worse. They did not understand how long it takes until meds are figured out: mine took two years. They most certainly would not truly understand why to this day, four years later, despite being ""stable"" I'm in counseling every other week in addition to being on meds. Rather than supporting that, it would be seen as ""oh, I'm sorry"". I was a problem to my manager because he didn't see improvements each week.
2) Accomodations.
- There was no option for me to reduce work temporarily to part-time (too complicated). Instead, they pushed me to take disability leave. I told them that wouldn't help; they told me to double-check with care providers. That required me to see a psychologist unnecessarily, as psychologist said I didn't qualify for leave. (Expensive, unnecessary appointment).
- The assistance I needed the most at work was understanding: I was open, but my manager told me to not tell my co-worker assigned to support me. That was disasterous for colleague's stress/frustration levels. He knew something was up, but was barred from asking and I was implied it was better to keep my mouth shut.
- Accommodations weren't understood by even Benefits, as they're not trained in mental health nor do they have people come in to assess how they're doing in supporting those with mental health issues. Should be no different than people coming in to assess for physical accessibility of the workplace. When in a meeting with my manager supervised by HR, I shouldn't feel like I'm asking too much of manager when requesting he put the negative critiques on the back burner and help me figure out whether I'm doing anything right. That this didn't stop him from coming into my office that same day and ""putting on my dick hat"" to yell at me for something that wasn't even my fault (he had brought in co-worker for this yelling, and turned to finish yelling at this person): FUCKING UNACCEPTABLE.

While I will never return to that company and as such took the severance package, I will NEVER agree with their legal reason for being unable to do the job: me being ""medically disqualified from this role"". I was too expensive in the short term for them; I'm not worth the cost.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014

I worked too much, had too much pressure on myself from being the sole developer on a delayed project that seemed to grow in size with each week it was delayed by and worried about money a lot.

I became depressed and anxious and had trouble eating, sleeping and generally being myself. As my depression worsened I was regularly late for work, couldn't perform as well as I should and became irritable with my colleagues.

My employers response, after a while, was to send me private messages complaining about my lateness which only worsened the situation. I was prescribed 3 weeks off work by my doctor, which my employer agreed to, only to come back after to find I had been on 'statutory pay' which was roughly half of what I was expecting and was not enough to cover my rent, bills AND food. This made me worse and sent me into another depression until I eventually admitted defeat, gave up working and left the company. It took me months to recover and I'm now left (over 6 months after this all started) recovering from the fallout I created leaving employment with hardly any money to my name.

I had previously been told by my employer that I ""was too young to burn out"" and (stupidly) trusted them. I did not feel comfortable discussing my problems with my employer because each time I was met with an attitude that I had to ""get myself together"" and ultimately, given the amount of employees before me who had left the company by being fired after an altercation with the employer, left me with no option but to hide it from them so I too wouldn't be fired.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014

Earlier in the year, a new 'no working from home' policy was brought in by the company owner, and so I felt like I had to stay and keep trying, despite not getting any progress made.  Eventually after discussing a plan of attack with my project manager, I met with HR and requested a few accommodations.  Specifically, a little more flexibility in hours and location of work.  If my anxiety was making working from the office impossible, I wanted to be able to go home, regroup for a couple hours, and make up that time later in the day / week.  HR and my manager were understanding and allowed this to occur.  There was a little followup from time to time just to ensure things weren't getting worse and that I wasn't taking advantage of the situation.

I've worked for companies where you are expected to leave your problems outside the door of the office.  I've worked for companies who want their employees to bring their whole selves to work.  To be very general my experiences are that the larger/older companies who in the past did not emphasize employee mental health as part of their company values have harder time supporting mental health than smaller/newer companies. The idea that mental health and work life balance should be protected and encouraged by employers is a relatively new thing (at least it seems that way to me).  I feel like the smaller or newer the company the easier it is to create the infrastructure to support employee mental health.,For context I have worked for 3 different tech companies. 2 of them were companies that could be labeled as being more traditionally corporate and my current employer began as a startup and has only in the past 3 or 4 years grown into a larger/stable company.

In many cases, people in other fields, through TV/sitcoms movies, etc., have been exposed to the higher incidence rates for certain issues in the tech industry, but mainly as a source of humor.

We need to look at the issue in both sides, one as an employee and another as an employer. As a company, you need to meet deliverables so you can earn and pay your employees. As an employee, you need that time so you can heal and perform better and help the company to grow. Taking into consideration this perspective, you can't really blame neither the company or the employee.

So how do we fix this? (and this answer will be based on my experiences)

1 - Physical health is important. If your body is not well, your mind will not be as well. A healthy diet and sports should be a part of every company incentives for a healthy life.

2 - Burnout: A stressed software engineer will surely burn out quickly. Stress sources can come from many places, but most of them come from work demand with unreasonable deadlines. If a developer is working more than 40 hours a week on a constant basis, burning out is just a matter of time. Knowing that burnout/stress is an issue, the employee and the company MUST address it properly.

3 - Culture: This one speaks to me personally. One of the issues that I had the most were environments where there is a poisonous culture generated by the development team. Improper leadership and cliques just add to a bad culture and that will lead to stress. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this. If the culture of the company is bad you are better of leaving.

4 - Clear expectations: Once an issue has been identified and treatment is in progress it is important that both the company and the employee have clear expectations. The stress that is generated by an expectation that was not laid out on the start will surely add up to the illness.",,0,White,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2019
